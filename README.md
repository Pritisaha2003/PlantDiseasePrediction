# Plant Disease Recognition System
The Plant Disease Recognition System is a web app using Streamlit and a pre-trained ML model to predict plant diseases from leaf images.

The Plant Disease Recognition System is a web app built using Streamlit and a pre-trained machine learning model to predict plant diseases from uploaded leaf images.
The app features multiple pages, including a Home page with the project overview, an About page with dataset and team details, and a Disease Recognition page where users
upload images to get disease predictions. The model processes the image and displays the result with a success message.
The appâ€™s interface includes visual effects and can be expanded with more diseases and features for public use.
